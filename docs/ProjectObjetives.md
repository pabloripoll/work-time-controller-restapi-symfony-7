# Project Objetives

The objective is to develop an API for employee signing-in management using PHP and Symfony, applying SOLID principles, CQRS, Hexagonal Architecture and DDD.

The system must allow employees to register their arrivals and departures, as well as view a record of all their clockings. Each clock-in must contain information on the date and time of entry/exit of the associated employee and any additional relevant information.
<br>

## Applied functionalities

1. **User CRUD**: Create, read, update and delete users.

2. **CRUD of Signings**: Create, read, update and delete employee signings.

3. **Login**: Create an access login that returns a token.

4. **Check-in Registration**: Implement check-in and check-out operations for employees.

5. **List of Signings**: Show a record of all the signings of an employee, ordered by date and time.

6. **Security**: Ensure that only authenticated employees can register their clockings and access their history.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is designed for:
- **Learning**: Understanding modern backend architecture in PHP
- **Reference**: Production-ready code examples and patterns
- **Experimentation**: Testing advanced architectural concepts
- **Portfolio**: Showcasing professional development practices

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design Patterns

The application implements industry-standard architectural patterns:

### **SOLID Principles**
- Single Responsibility
- Open/Closed
- Liskov Substitution
- Interface Segregation
- Dependency Inversion

### **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**
- Clear domain boundaries
- Ubiquitous language
- Aggregates and entities
- Value objects
- Domain services

### **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**
- Separated read and write operations
- Command handlers for mutations
- Query handlers for data retrieval
- Clear intent and responsibility

### **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)**
- Domain layer independence
- Infrastructure abstraction
- Testable business logic
- Flexible adapter implementations

### **Event-Driven Design**
- Domain events
- Event dispatching
- Audit logging system
- Decoupled components

## ✨ Key Features
